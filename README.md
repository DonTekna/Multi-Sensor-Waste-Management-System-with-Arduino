# Multi-Sensor-Waste-Management-System-with-Arduino
This Arduino code manages a waste system using various sensors and actuators: it controls a light based on light levels, detects motion to activate LEDs, sounds an alarm for high gas levels, and opens or closes a door based on distance measurements. It provides real-time updates and control through these components.
